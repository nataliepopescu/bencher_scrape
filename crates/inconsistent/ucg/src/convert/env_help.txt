Env conversions expect a tuple. With keys represent the variable name.

Values are converted according to the following rules:

- Bool converts to "true" or "false"
- Int convert to the string representation of the number
- Float converts to the string representation of the number
- String converts to a quoted string
- All other values are ignored
