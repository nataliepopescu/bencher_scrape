Flags converts a tuple into a set of command line arguments for command line application.

The flags are converted using the following rules:

- keys in a tuple are converted into the argument name.
- values in a tuple are converted into the argument value with following exceptions:
   - NULL values print out only the key name for the flag.
   - lists expand out into an argument for each item in the list.
     e.g. {{foo = [1, 2]}} becomes --foo=1 --foo=2
   - Tuples, Functions and Modules are ignored.
