TOML conversions expect any ucg value.

They are transformed into toml using the following rules:

- tuples become maps `{...}`
- lists become lists `[...]`
- Int becomes an Int
- Float becomes a Float
- Strings become Strings.
- NULL is not allowed in toml documents and will generate a compile error
- Functions and Modules are ignored.
