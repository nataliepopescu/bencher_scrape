## Example

```rust
struct Example;

impl Pipeline for Example {
    type Vertex = [f32; 2];
    type VsOut = ();
    type Pixel = [u8; 4];

    // Vertex shader
    fn vert(&self, pos: &Self::Vertex) -> ([f32; 3], Self::VsOut) {
        ([pos[0], pos[1], 0.0], ())
    }

    // Fragment shader
    fn frag(&self, _: &Self::VsOut) -> Self::Pixel {
        [255, 0, 0, 255] // Red
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut color = Buffer2d::new([640, 480], [0; 4]);
    let mut depth = Buffer2d::new([640, 480], 1.0);

    Example.draw::<Triangles<_>, _>(
        &[
            [-1.0, -1.0],
            [ 1.0, -1.0],
            [ 0.0,  1.0],
        ],
        &mut color,
        &mut depth,
    );
}
```

## What is `euc`?

`euc` is a versatile, simple to use crate that allows 3D rendering on the CPU. It has a portable, compact design that makes it perfect for
prototyping ideas, unit testing, or even simple realtime applications. `euc` is currently under active development.

## Why?

- Modern graphics APIs are complex, verbose beasts. Rendering with the CPU means less complexity, less boilerplate and less verbosity:
  perfect for testing ideas.

- Modern CPUs are fast enough to make simple 3D programs run at reasonable speeds (although they are of course no match for GPUs). It's
  possible to write surprisingly complex realtime 3D software with the CPU only.

- Not requiring a GPU interface means that `euc` is incredibly portable. As a result, `euc` is `no_std` (if you have a nightly compiler).

- `euc` has consistent cross-platform behaviour and doesn't require a GPU to run. This makes it perfect for use as a unit testing tool.

- Running on the CPU allows a more dynamic approach to data access.
  For applications in which performance is less of a concern, `euc` lowers the barrier of low-level 3D development and allows for more novel
  approaches to graphics rendering to be realised.

## Coordinate System

Where possible, `euc` tries to use a coordinate system similar in nature to OpenGL. If you're used to OpenGL, you'll have no trouble working
with `euc`.

## Release Mode

Cargo, by default, compiles Rust code in debug mode. In this mode, very few optimisations are made upon the code, and as a result the
performance of software rendering tends to suffer. To experience this project with good performance, make sure to compile with the
`--release` flag.

## `no_std`

`euc` can be compiled on platforms that lack standard library support. This makes it ideal for rendering 3D graphics on embedded devices.
You can enable `no_std` support by disabling the default features and enabling the `libm` feature in your `Cargo.toml` file like so:

```toml
[dependencies]
euc = { version = "x.y.z", default-features = false, features = ["libm"] }
```

## Goals

- Support programmable shaders written in Rust

- Support common pipeline features such as texture samplers, multiple rendering passes, uniform data, etc.

- Simple, elegant interface that scales well

- Correctness

## Non-Goals

- Extreme optimisation (although obvious low-hanging fruit will be picked)

- Compliance/compatibility with an existing API (i.e: OpenGL)
